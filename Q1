Question: 1

P (C sunny/ a cone of ice-cream) = ? P (rainy /a cup of hot coffee)=?

It is provided that each of the occurance is independent. So,

P (a cone of ice cream) = P(a) (cone) P(of) P(ice) P(cream)

Part: A

P(Sunny/a cone of Ice-cream)

Bayes theorem :P(A/B) = (PB/A)*P(A)/P(B)

So the probability of (Sunny/a cone of Ice-cream) is,

P (Sunny/a cone of Ice-cream) = P (a cone of Ice-cream/sunny) * (P (sunny)/ P(a cone of Ice-cream)) Also, as stated earlier the each of the occurance is independent: the tags with higher possibilities are classified by neglecting the denominator therefore: -

P (Sunny/a cone of Ice-cream) = P(a/sunny) * P (Cone/sunny) * P (of/ sunny) * P(Ice/ sunny)* P (Cream/sunny)* P (Sunny)

Part: B

Similarly as above,

P (rainy/a cup of hot coffee) = P(a/rainy).P(cup/rainy).P(of/rainy).P(hot/rainy).P(coffee/rainy).P(rainy)
